# Kasper Landing Page

A visually rich and interactive one-page website built using HTML and CSS. Created on **November 7, 2023**, this project explores advanced UI techniques such as creative hover effects, smooth animations, and structured content flow — all crafted without JavaScript.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project was built by following a YouTube tutorial. While the design is not original, the implementation was done entirely by me as a hands-on exercise to deepen my understanding of layout architecture, animation logic, and responsive design.
